✅ TCS Bench Policy (2025 Updated Overview)
The TCS Bench Policy refers to the guidelines and processes for employees who are not currently assigned to a billable project (commonly called "on bench").

🧾 What Does "Bench" Mean in TCS?
In TCS, bench refers to:

A period when an employee is not actively working on a client project but is still part of the organization and receives a salary.
